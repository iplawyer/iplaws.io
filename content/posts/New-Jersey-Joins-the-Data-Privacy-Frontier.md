&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wake of world-wide disturbance over Facebook disclosures
following the U.S. election, the new GDPR[^1] data protection and collection
requirements that took effect this year, and concerns about household
appliances that can be used for surveillance, privacy has been at the
forefront of social and legal landscape. As technology trends are
examined and understood more, public call for more transparency and more
stringent data protections increases. Long the pioneer in privacy
regulation, this summer California passed AB 375[^2], also known as the
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.

&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, California's law which takes effect in 2020, enabled
Californians to know what data about them is collected and stored by
companies, the purpose of the collection, and who the data is shared
with. The law also allows Californians to opt out of the sale of their
data, request deletion of their data and provides for a private cause of
action for violations of the law. Armed with California's version of the
Bill governing the collection and use of consumer data, New Jersey
introduced its own consumer privacy regulation, NJ S2834[^3], in July 2018.

&nbsp;&nbsp; NJ S2834[^3] requires notification from commercial Internet websites and
online services about their collection and disclosure of personally
identifiable information. Personally identifiable information is defined
as information that personally identifies, describes or is able to be
associated with a customer of a commercial Internet website or online
service. NJ S2834[^3] provides a broad list of information elements that can
be considered personally identifiable. It includes demographic,
biometric, geographic, medical, financial information among other types
of information, such as information relating to political and religious
affiliations or activities. Interestingly, NJ S2834[^3] encompasses these
categories of information not only as they pertain to the customer but
also the customer's children.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The application of the Bill to customers' children leaves open many
questions. For example, if the child's information is considered the
customer's personal information only if it is collected from the
parent-customer or if it collected directly from the child as well and
what implications this distinction has in the enforcement of the rights
provided by the law to consumers such as the opt-out of the selling of
the customer's information. Of course, it is possible and even likely
that by the time NJ S2834[^3] passes, if it does, that it will undergo many
revisions and the categories of personal information, as well as the
application of the requirements to the information will be narrowed and
better defined.

&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the requirements of NJ S2834[^3], like AB 375[^2], it allows
consumers to obtain a complete description of the personally
identifiable information collected about them, notification of what is
shared with third parties, including the third party's identity. The
Bill also requires a clear and visible link to "Do Not Sell My Personal
Information" and imposes prohibitions against discrimination of
customers who choose to opt-out of the sale of their information. The
Bill also provides that operators not ask a consumer for authorization
to share information for 12-months following the consumer's choice to
opt-out, which leaves the question of how this prohibition applies to
information collected by one operator of different websites or a single
operator collecting different categories of information for different
types of services is appled. Another important characteristic of NJ S2834[^3] is that, unlike AB 375[^2], it does not provide a private cause of
action for violations of this law.

&nbsp;&nbsp; NJ S2834[^3] is in its early stages and will undergo a lot more scrutiny
going forward, but it is certainly a breakthrough piece of legislation
following what will undoubtedly become a large trend among the states. I
am interested to see further developments in this domain.
